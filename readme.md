# Blog with responsive Design

This is a simple minimalistic blog design that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Features
1. We use grid to arrange recent posts, along with wrapping them automatically using auto fit for differnt screen sizes.
2. We use flexbox to arrange the more simpler sections such is navigation bar.
3. We use rem, em and % as units which are responsive to browser/can be changed via root node.
4. One can navigate to different pages with the navigation menu. 
5.The different navigation links are animated as well!
